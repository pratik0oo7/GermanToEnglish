# GermanToEnglish

The objective of the project is to implement language
translation model aka machine translation for converting
German to English (and vice versa)
For this, the data is a text file (.txt) of English-German sentence
pairs. The actual data contains over 150,000 sentence-pairs.
However, it is suggested to use only the first 50,000 sentence
pairs to reduce the training time of the model.
You can download the Data set from
